       "     Banks simplify people’s lives, but the business of banking is anything but simple. Every transaction — from cashing a check to taking out a loan — requires careful record keeping. Behind the scenes in every bank or savings and loan association there are dozens of bank clerks, each an expert at keeping one area of he bank’s business running smoothly. New account clerks  open and close accounts and answer questions for customers. Interest clerks record interest due to savings account customers, as well as the interest owed to the bank on loans and other investments. Exchange clerks, who work on international accounts, translate foreign currency values into dollars and vice versa. Loan clerks sort and record information about loans. Statement clerks are responsible for preparing the monthly balance sheets of checking account customers. Securities clerks record, file, and maintain stocks, bonds, and other investment certificates. They also keep track of dividends and interest on these certificates. Other clerks operate the business  machines on which modern banks rely. Proof operators sort checks and record the amount of each check. Bookkeeping  clerks keep records of each customer’s account. In addition to these specialists, banks need general clerical help — data entry  keyers, file clerks, mail handlers, and messengers — just as  any other business does. ",
       "     Education and Training Requirements",
       "     Bank clerks usually need a high school education with an emphasis on basic skills in typing, bookkeeping, and business math. Knowledge of computers and business machines is also helpful. Prospective bank workers may be tested on their clerical skills when they are interviewed. Most banks provide new employees with on-the-job training",
       "     Getting the Job",
       "     Sometimes bank recruiters visit high schools to look for future employees. High school placement offices can tell students whether this is the practice at their school. If not, prospective bank workers can apply directly to local banks through their personnel departments. Bank jobs may be listed with state and private employment agencies. Candidates can also check Internet job sites and the classified ads in local newspapers as well.",
       "     Advancement Possibilities and Employment Outlook",
       "     Banks prefer to promote their employees rather than hire new workers for jobs that require experience. Clerks frequently become tellers or supervisors. Many banks encourage their employees to further their education at night. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of bank clerks was expected to decline through the year 2014, because many banks are electronically automating their systems and eliminating paperwork as well as many clerical tasks. Workers with knowledge of data processing and computers will have the best opportunities. In addition to jobs created through expansion, openings at the clerical level often occur as workers move up to positions of greater responsibility",

       "     Although banks usually provide a pleasant working atmosphere, clerks often work alone, at times performing repetitive tasks. Bank clerks generally work between thirty- five and forty hours per week, but they may be expected to take on evening and Saturday shifts depending on bank hours.",
       "     Earnings and Benefits",
       "     The salaries of bank clerks vary widely depending on the size and location of the bank and the clerk’s experience. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, median salaries ranged from $23,317 to $27,310 per year in 2004 depending on experience and title. Generally, loan clerks are on the high end of this range, whereas general office clerks are on the lower end. Banks typically offer their employees excellent benefits. Besides paid vacations and more than the usual number of paid holidays, employees may receive health and life insurance and participate in pension and profit-sharing plans.

       "     The world is obviously not a place where features such as resources, people and economic activities are randomly distributed; there is a logic, or an order, to spatial distribution. Geography seeks to understand the spatial order of things as well as their interactions, particularly when the spatial order is less evident.

       "     Transportation is of relevance to geography for two main reasons. First, transport infrastructures, terminals, modes and networks occupy an important place in space and constitute the basis of a complex spatial system. Second, since geography seeks to explain spatial relationships, transport networks are of specific interest because they are the main physical support of these interactions.",
       "     Transport geography, as a discipline, emerged as a branch of economic geography in the second half of the twentieth century. In earlier considerations, particularly in commercial geography (late 19th and early 20th century), transportation was an important factor behind the economic representations of the geographic space, namely in terms of the location of economic activities and the monetary costs of distance. These cost considerations became the foundation of several geographical theories such as central places and location analysis. The growing mobility of passengers and freight justified the emergence of transport geography as a specialized field of investigation.",
       "     In the 1960s, transport had to be formalized as key factors in location theories and transport geography began to rely increasingly on quantitative methods, particularly over network and spatial interactions analysis. However, from the 1970s, technical, political and economic changes challenged the centrality of transportation in many geographical and regional development investigations. The strong spatial anchoring effect of high transportation costs receded and decentralization was a dominant paradigm that was observed within cities (suburbanization), but also within regions. The spatial theory foundations of transport geography, particularly the friction of distance, became less relevant, or less evident, in explaining socioeconomic processes. As a result, transportation became underrepresented in economic geography in the 1970s and 1980s, even if the mobility of people and freight and low transport costswere considered as imporrtant factors behind the globalization of trade and production.",
       "     Since the 1990s, transport geography has received renewed attention with new realms of investigation. The issues of mobility, production and distribution became interrelated in a complex geographical setting where the local, regional and global became increasingly blurred through the development of new passengers and freight transport systems (Hoyle and Knowles, 1998). For instance, suburbanization resulted in an array of challenges related to congestion and automobile dependency. Rapid urbanization in developing economies underlined the challenges of transport infrastructure investment  for private as well as collective uses. Globalization supported the development of complex air and maritime transportation networks, many of which supporting global supply chains and trade relations across long distances.

       "     Cheap, easy credit might have been tempting to young people in the past, but not to today’s millennials. According to a recent survey by Bankrate of over 1,161 consumers, 63% of adults ages 18 to 29 live without a credit card of any kind, and another 23% only carry one card.",
       "     The Impact of the Great Recession",
       "     Research shows that the environment millennials grew up in might have an impact on their finances. Unlike other generations, millennials lived through economic hardships during a time when their adult lives were beginning.

        textoS: ["    Millennials – The next generation of oil and gas talent",
       "     Good oil and gas talent is in short supply. Combine the so-called “Big Shift Change” with the reduced number of students applying for and completing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) courses in college, and there is a serious concern about where the next generation of industry talent will come from.",
       "     As oil and gas companies bring in new talent to meet staffing demands, CEB research shows that five-in-six hiring managers believe their new graduate hires present a lack of the skills and knowledge they consider necessary. But rather than changing their hiring strategies to find candidates with  the potential to learn and develop those skills and knowledge, many companies continue to waste money on ineffective and poorly targeted recruitment programs. As a result, these companies are forced to replace a growing percentage of their graduate hires within the first year.",
       "     One thing is for certain – millennials, or workers born between 1980 and 2000, will be a critical part of the oil and gas workforce of tomorrow. So how can today’s oil and gas leaders find strong millennial talent who make an impact quickly? We’ve identified several tips for companies that want to see greater return on investment for millennial recruitment.",
       "     1. Broaden your net beyond only those with top grades and use objective assessments ",
       "     Strong academic performers aren’t always those who will  perform best in the job. Recruiting from good schools and  evaluating academic performance will always be",
       "     important, and every company wants to hire smart people. However, grades are not a perfect measure of how smart someone is, and they do not necessarily reflect all the characteristics that make a person successful on the job. The job candidate with a 3.1 GPA who worked full-time while going to school may have demonstrated drive, motivation, time management and resourcefulness – all of which are beneficial on the job. This person can be just as qualified as a top student. Using objective assessments to measure employability – a comprehensive evaluation of hard and soft skills and overall potential – improves the odds of finding the right hires for the business.",
       "     2. Use, but don’t overestimate, social media",
       "     Unsurprisingly, millennials are more likely than any other generation to use social media to learn about organizations. Nonetheless, less than a third actually trust the information they receive through social channels. Regardless of generation, job seekers place the most trust in personal connections such as friends and family, so continue to invest in traditional channels such as on-campus recruiting, job fairs, and referral programs. Using technology and social media in the recruiting process is important, but they should supplement and enhance existing efforts rather than replace them.",
       "     3. Understand millennial motivations",
       "     To attract the best millennial workers, understand what  motivates them. Our research shows this generation is actually motivated by opportunities to develop and grow, demonstrate the talents they have, and move up in the company, rather than by salary. Incidentally, other generations are interested in these things too, and showing a commitment to developing employees will help retain existing employees as well as attract new ones.",
       "     4. Remember that new hires don’t always have to be work-ready",
       "     Graduate hires may not have the necessary skills to be successful on day one. When casting a wider net to find new talent, look for ways to assess candidates’ capacity to learn, drive for achievement and ability to work effectively with others. There is an increased likelihood that candidates with high measures in those areas can develop into successful employees, even if they do not possess the full range of technical knowledge and skills when hired. Once they are hired, identify and invest in developing the skills that graduates need to flourish in the job today and prepare for future roles.",
       "     5. Avoid recruiting simply to fill vacancies  ",
       "     Successful companies find a balance between responding to management demands to fill current vacancies and securing the right people to meet long-term business needs. Openings will always need to be filled, but the urgency to hire for today’s vacancies should be tempered with the goal of hiring people who will grow with the organization. Many successful oil and gas companies are hiring for fit with the overall company rather than for a specific job. A talented engineer with strong capacity for learning and potential for growth is someone worth investing in, even if a perfect role isn’t available at the present time.",
       "     6. Offer diverse experiences",
       "     A common myth about millennials is that they are only looking to stay with a given company for a short time before moving on. However, our research shows that millennials view employment stability as very important but they are also looking for varied experiences. By offering diverse career experiences and clarifying the benefit of moves with the organization, millennials will be more likely to stay in one place.",
       "     With a growing need for new talent in the sector, most oil and gas companies will feel pressure to hire new millennial employees as rapidly as possible. However, making incorrect assumptions about how millennials think and hiring for short-term rather than long-term goals will be ineffective. Companies will see the most success in attracting top millennial talent by taking a more thoughtful, objective and company-specific approach to hiring.",

Combine the so-called “Big Shift Change” with the reduced number of students applying for and completing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) courses in college, and there is a serious concern about where the next generation of industry talent will come from.",
       "     As oil and gas companies bring in new talent to meet staffing demands, CEB research shows that five-in-six hiring managers believe their new graduate hires present a lack of the skills and knowledge they consider necessary. But rather than changing their hiring strategies to find candidates with  the potential to learn and develop those skills and knowledge, many companies continue to waste money on ineffective and poorly targeted recruitment programs. As a result, these companies are forced to replace a growing percentage of their graduate hires within the first year.",
       "     One thing is for certain – millennials, or workers born between 1980 and 2000, will be a critical part of the oil and gas workforce of tomorrow. So how can today’s oil and gas leaders find strong millennial talent who make an impact quickly? We’ve identified several tips for companies that want to see greater return on investment for millennial recruitment.",
       "     1. Broaden your net beyond only those with top grades and use objective assessments ",
       "     Strong academic performers aren’t always those who will  perform best in the job. Recruiting from good schools and  evaluating academic performance will always be",
       "     important, and every company wants to hire smart people. However, grades are not a perfect measure of how smart someone is, and they do not necessarily reflect all the characteristics that make a person successful on the job. The job candidate with a 3.1 GPA who worked full-time while going to school may have demonstrated drive, motivation, time management and resourcefulness – all of which are beneficial on the job. This person can be just as qualified as a top student. Using objective assessments to measure employability – a comprehensive evaluation of hard and soft skills and overall potential – improves the odds of finding the right hires for the business.",
       "     2. Use, but don’t overestimate, social media",
       "     Unsurprisingly, millennials are more likely than any other generation to use social media to learn about organizations. Nonetheless, less than a third actually trust the information they receive through social channels. Regardless of generation, job seekers place the most trust in personal connections such as friends and family, so continue to invest in traditional channels such as on-campus recruiting, job fairs, and referral programs. Using technology and social media in the recruiting process is important, but they should supplement and enhance existing efforts rather than replace them.",
       "     3. Understand millennial motivations",
       "     To attract the best millennial workers, understand what  motivates them. Our research shows this generation is actually motivated by opportunities to develop and grow, demonstrate the talents they have, and move up in the company, rather than by salary. Incidentally, other generations are interested in these things too, and showing a commitment to developing employees will help retain existing employees as well as attract new ones.",
       "     4. Remember that new hires don’t always have to be work-ready",
       "     Graduate hires may not have the necessary skills to be successful on day one. When casting a wider net to find new talent, look for ways to assess candidates’ capacity to learn, drive for achievement and ability to work effectively with others. There is an increased likelihood that candidates with high measures in those areas can develop into successful employees, even if they do not possess the full range of technical knowledge and skills when hired. Once they are hired, identify and invest in developing the skills that graduates need to flourish in the job today and prepare for future roles.",
       "     5. Avoid recruiting simply to fill vacancies  ",
       "     Successful companies find a balance between responding to management demands to fill current vacancies and securing the right people to meet long-term business needs. Openings will always need to be filled, but the urgency to hire for today’s vacancies should be tempered with the goal of hiring people who will grow with the organization. Many successful oil and gas companies are hiring for fit with the overall company rather than for a specific job. A talented engineer with strong capacity for learning and potential for growth is someone worth investing in, even if a perfect role isn’t available at the present time.",
       "     6. Offer diverse experiences",
       "     A common myth about millennials is that they are only looking to stay with a given company for a short time before moving on. However, our research shows that millennials view employment stability as very important but they are also looking for varied experiences. By offering diverse career experiences and clarifying the benefit of moves with the organization, millennials will be more likely to stay in one place.",
       "     With a growing need for new talent in the sector, most oil and gas companies will feel pressure to hire new millennial employees as rapidly as possible. However, making incorrect assumptions about how millennials think and hiring for short-term rather than long-term goals will be ineffective. Companies will see the most success in attracting top millennial talent by taking a more thoughtful, objective and company-specific approach to hiring.",

       "     Cars and trucks powered by natural gas make up a significant portion of the vehicle fleet in many parts of the world. Iran has more than two million natural gas vehicles on the road. As of 2009, Argentina had more than 1.8 million in operation and almost 2,000 natural gas filling stations. Brazil was not far behind. Italy and Germany have substantial natural gas vehicle fleets. Is America next?",
       "     With natural gas in plentiful supply at bargain prices in the United States, issues that have limited its use in cars are being rethought, and its market share could increase, perhaps substantially.",
       "     According to Energy Department Price Information from July, natural gas offers economic advantages over gasoline and diesel fuels. If a gasoline-engine vehicle can take you 40 miles on one gallon, the same vehicle running on compressed natural gas can do it for about $1.50 less at today’s prices. To that savings add lower maintenance costs. A study of New York City cabs running on natural gas found that oil changes need not be as frequent because of the clean burn of the fuel, and exhaustsystem parts last longer because natural gas is less corrosive than other fuels.",
       "     Today, those economic benefits are nullified by the initial cost of a natural gas vehicle — 20 to 30 percent more than a comparable gasoline-engine vehicle. But were production to increase significantly, economies of scale would bring prices down. In an interview by phone, Jon Coleman, fleet sustainability manager at the Ford Motor Company, said that given sufficient volume, the selling price of natural gas vehicles could be comparable to that of conventional vehicles.",
       "     It may be years before the economic benefits of natural gas vehicles can be realized, but the environmental benefits appear to be immediate. According to the Energy Department’s website, natural gas vehicles have smaller carbon footprints than gasoline or diesel automobiles, even when taking into account the natural gas production process, which releases carbon-rich methane into the atmosphere.",
       "     The United States government appears to favor natural gas as a motor vehicle fuel. To promote the production of vehicles with fewer carbon emissions, it has allowed automakers to count certain vehicle types more than once when calculating their Corporate Average Fuel Economy, under regulations mandating a fleet average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025. Plug-in hybrids and natural gas vehicles can be counted 1.6 times under the CAFE standards, and electric vehicles can be counted twice.",
       "     Adapting natural gas as a vehicle fuel introduces engineering challenges. While the fuel burns clean, it is less energy dense than gasoline, so if it is burned in an engine designed to run on conventional fuel, performance and efficiency are degraded.",
       "     But since natural gas has an octane rating of 130, compared with 93 for the best gasoline, an engine designed for it can run with very high cylinder pressure, which would cause a regular gasoline engine to knock from premature ignition. More cylinder pressure yields more power, and thus the energy-density advantage of gasoline can be nullified.[...]",
       "     Until the pressurized fuel tanks of natural gas vehicles can be easily and quickly refueled, the fleet cannot grow substantially. The number of commercial refueling stations for compressed natural gas has been increasing at a rate of 16 percent yearly, the Energy Department says. And, while the total is still small, advances in refueling equipment should increase the rate of expansion. Much of the infrastructure is already in place: America has millions of miles of natural gas pipeline. Connecting that network to refueling equipment is not difficult.",
       "     Although commercial refueling stations will be necessary to support a substantial fleet of natural gas vehicles, home refueling may be the magic bullet that makes the vehicles practical. Electric vehicles depend largely on home charging and most have less than half the range of a fully fueled natural gas vehicle. Somecompressed natural gas home refueling products are available, but they can cost as much as $5,000.",

        textoS: ["    An Introduction to the Oil Patch",
       "     So you’re thinking about a field job in the oil industry. If you haven’t been involved in the oil patch before, you probably have no idea how vast it is, or where to start your job search. Many sites will try to convince you that you can get a job on an offshore rig making $10,000 a month without any experience  or training at all, and while this is possible, it’s not at all likely. Actually, it can be tough to find a job in any field of the oil industry without some experience or training.",
       "     First, you should realize that the oil industry isn’t just drilling rigs, pumpjacks, and gas stations. The oil industry is a lot like the military in that it employs people in nearly every profession. There are positions such as roughneck or airgun operator, that are very specific to the oil industry; but there are also welders, medics, chemists, biologists, environmentalists, cooks, computer programmers, engineers, and a thousand more positions that are absolutely essential to the industry. You don’t have to have experience specifically in the oil industry in order to have relevant experience.",
       "     The oil patch is a little bit different from most other industries. You’ll soon lose the idea of a weekend as you now know it... The patch runs seven days a week, and in many cases, 24  hours a day. You’ll be expected to work every day in all weather conditions, for weeks or even months at a time. The oil industry is also very production oriented; you’ll make more money welding in the oil patch than in another industry, but you’ll work longer and harder for that bigger paycheck.",
       "     There are a few prerequisites if you want a field job in the oil patch:",
       "     You must be in reasonably good physical condition, and  be able to lift at least 50 lbs. regularly. For most positions, you must have a valid driver’s license",
       "     You must have suitable clothing for extended outdoor work and in most cases, hard toed safety boots. You should not have any medical condition which would make it unsafe for you to operate machinery.",
       "     You don’t need to live in the city where your employer is located, but in most cases you will have to provide your own transportation to and from your home from the employer’s location (point-of-hire).

If you have back or other health problems that prevent strenuous activity, you may want to reconsider this line of work. Most companies require employees to be at least 18 years old. A recent hearing test and/or medical evaluation may be required.",
       "     Many oilfield companies also require a preemployment  drug and alcohol screening. You should know that though you  can make a lot of money in a month in the oil patch, you can also make no money in a month. Most oilfield work isn’t very stable, and you’ll occasionally find yourself laid-off on short notice due to a shortage of work... and called back on even shorter notice. Many people in Canada work in the oil industry during the winter while it’s busy, then take the spring and summer off, or work non- oilfield summer jobs.",
       "     Offshore and overseas rigs usually operate yearround, offering a much more stable work environment; but there are very few positions on these rigs that are available without any experience. If you’re interested in working on one of these rigs, you may want to start with a catering job. All major offshore and overseas projects employ catering staff to provide meals for the rig crew. These positions are often available without experience, and rig managers will often hire catering staff onto the rig crew if they need an extra hand, or if a member of the rig crew gets injured or leaves. It’s a matter of being in the right place at the right time, and showing interest in working on the rig.",

       "     One remarkable story of a successful Google grouplet involved getting engineers to write their own testing code to reduce the incidence of bugs in software code. Thinking creatively, the grouplet came up with a campaign based on posting episodes discussing new and interesting testing techniques on the bathroom stalls. “Testing on the Toilet” spread fast and garnered both rants and raves.

   "     Woman 1: I went to a university that all major oil companies recruit. I received a summer internship with Texaco before my last year of my Master’s degree.",
   "     Woman 2: I was recruited at a Texas Tech Engineering Job Fair.",

When the company sold its division in the state where I was working, they offered me a position at the company’s headquarters in Houston managing the aftermarket sales for the company’s largest region. Aftermarket sales supported the on-highway, construction, industrial, agricultural and the oil and gas markets.

I left that company to join a new startup company where I hold the position of president.",
   "     Woman 5: My first job in the oil and gas industry was an internship with Mobil Oil Corp., in New Orleans.I worked with a lot of smart, focused and talented geoscientists and engineers.",

   "     Woman 1: Tough one to describe a typical day. I generally read email, go to a couple of meetings and work with the field’s earth model or look at seismic.",

   "     Woman 3: I usually work from 7:30 a.m. – 6:30 p.m. (although the official day is shorter). We call the field every morning for an update on operations, security, construction, facilities and production engineering activities. I work with my team leads on short-term and long-term projects to enhance production (a lot of emails and Powerpoint). I usually have 2-3 meetings per day to discuss/prioritize/review ongoing or upcoming work (production optimization, simulation modeling, drilling plans, geologic interpretation, workovers, etc.). Beyond our  team, I also participate in a number of broader business initiatives and leadership teams",
   "     Woman 4: A typical day is a hectic day for me. My day usually starts well before 8 a.m. with phone calls and emails with our facility in Norway, as well as other business relationships abroad. At the office, I am involved in the daily business operations and also stay closely involved in the projects and the sales efforts. On any given day I am working on  budgets and finance, attending project meetings, attending engineering meetings, reviewing drawings and technical specifications, meeting with clients and prospective clients, reviewing sales proposals, evaluating new business opportunities  and making a lot of decisions.",
   "     Woman 5: On most days I work on my computer to complete my projects. I interpret logs, create maps, research local and regional geology or write documents. I go to project meetings almost every day. I typically work only during business hours, but there are times when I get calls at night or on weekends from a rig or other geologists for assistance with a technical problem.",
